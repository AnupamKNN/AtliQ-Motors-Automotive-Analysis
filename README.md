## About the Company

AtliQ Motors is a leading automotive company based in the USA, specializing in electric vehicles (EVs). Over the past five years, AtliQ Motors has significantly increased its market share to 25% in the electric and hybrid vehicle segment across North America. This growth highlights the company’s commitment to innovation and sustainability in the automotive industry.

## Problem Statement

As part of their ambitious expansion strategy, AtliQ Motors is set to introduce their bestselling electric vehicle (EV) models to the Indian market, where their current market share is less than 2%. Recognizing the potential for growth in this burgeoning market, Bruce Haryali, the Chief of AtliQ Motors India, has emphasized the need for a thorough understanding of the existing EV and hybrid vehicle landscape in India. To this end, he has tasked the data analytics team with conducting an in-depth market study. Leading this crucial project is Peter Pandey, a skilled data analyst at AtliQ Motors, who will leverage advanced data analytics techniques to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations. This study aims to identify key market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive dynamics to inform AtliQ Motors’ market entry strategy and ensure a successful launch.
